# Timer Web Worker Implementation

## Overview
The flight progress timer has been updated to use Web Workers for more reliable time tracking. This ensures the timer continues running accurately even when the browser tab is inactive or not in focus.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Web Worker (`public/workers/timer-worker.js`)
A dedicated Web Worker that handles all timer logic in a separate thread:

**Features:**
- Runs independently of the main thread
- Continues counting even when the page is inactive
- Provides accurate time tracking regardless of browser tab state
- Handles START, PAUSE, RESUME, RESET, STOP, and GET_TIME commands

**Message Types:**
- `START` - Starts the timer with an optional initial seconds value
- `PAUSE` - Pauses the timer without resetting
- `RESUME` - Resumes a paused timer
- `RESET` - Resets timer to zero
- `STOP` - Stops and cleans up the timer
- `GET_TIME` - Requests current time update
- `TIME_UPDATE` - Response with current elapsed seconds and running state
- `STATUS` - Status updates (started, paused, resumed, reset, stopped)

### 2. Updated Component (`src/app/components/elements/career/flight-progress/index.jsx`)

**Key Changes:**
- Replaced `timerIntervalRef` with `workerRef` to reference the Web Worker
- Updated `useEffect` to initialize and manage the Web Worker lifecycle
- Modified `handleFinishFlight()` to pause timer via worker message
- Modified `handleSave()` to pause timer via worker message
- Worker automatically starts with saved `elapsedSeconds` from draft flight
- Worker is properly terminated on component unmount

## How It Works

### On Modal Open:
1. Component mounts and creates a new Web Worker
2. Worker receives START message with `initialSeconds` from `draftFlight.elapsedSeconds`
3. Timer begins counting from the saved value (or 0 if new flight)
4. Worker sends TIME_UPDATE messages every second
5. Component updates UI with current elapsed time

### On Save (Pause & Save):
1. User clicks "Pause & Save" button
2. Component sends PAUSE message to worker
3. Current `elapsedSeconds` is saved to localStorage via `updateDraftFlight()`
4. Page reloads and modal closes

### On Continue (Next Session):
1. Modal opens again with the same draft flight
2. Worker starts with saved `elapsedSeconds` value
3. Timer continues from where it left off
4. User sees accurate accumulated time across sessions

### On Finish Flight:
1. User clicks "Finish Flight" button
2. Component sends PAUSE message to worker
3. Final duration is calculated and passed to `onFinishFlight()`
4. Flight is completed with total accumulated time

### On Component Unmount:
1. Component sends STOP message to worker
2. Worker clears its interval and stops
3. Worker is terminated to free resources

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Timer continues running even when:
   - Browser tab is inactive
   - User switches to another application
   - Browser throttles background tabs
   - Page is minimized

2. **Accuracy**: Web Workers run in a separate thread and are not affected by:
   - Main thread blocking operations
   - Heavy UI rendering
   - JavaScript execution delays

3. **Performance**: Offloads timer logic from main thread, keeping UI responsive

4. **Consistency**: Same logic for starting, pausing, and resuming across sessions

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Basic Timer Test**:
   - Open flight progress modal
   - Verify timer starts counting
   - Wait 10 seconds and verify accuracy

2. **Inactive Tab Test**:
   - Start timer
   - Switch to another tab for 30 seconds
   - Return and verify timer continued counting accurately

3. **Save & Continue Test**:
   - Start timer and let it run for 1 minute
   - Click "Pause & Save"
   - Reopen the same draft flight
   - Verify timer continues from ~60 seconds

4. **Multiple Sessions Test**:
   - Start timer, wait 30 seconds, save
   - Reopen, wait 30 seconds, save
   - Reopen, wait 30 seconds, finish
   - Verify total time is ~90 seconds (1.5 minutes, rounded to 60 min minimum)

5. **Manual Input Test**:
   - Verify "Enter manually" toggle still works
   - Verify manual input validation (minimum 60 minutes)
   - Verify switching back to timer mode

## File Structure

```

├── public/
│   └── workers/
│       └── timer-worker.js          # New Web Worker file
└── src/

                        └── index.jsx  # Updated component

## Browser Compatibility

Web Workers are supported in all modern browsers:
- Chrome 4+
- Firefox 3.5+
- Safari 4+
- Edge (all versions)
- Opera 10.6+

## Notes

- The worker file is placed in `public/workers/` so it's accessible via `/workers/timer-worker.js`
- Worker is properly cleaned up on component unmount to prevent memory leaks
- Error handling is included for worker errors
- All existing functionality (manual input, validation, UI) remains unchanged
