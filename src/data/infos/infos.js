  "Maximum Operating Altitude": "The maximum altitude at which the aircraft can operate safely.",
  "Cruise Speed": "The speed at which the aircraft cruises at.",
  "Range": "The maximum distance the aircraft can fly.",
  "VMO": "VMO (Maximum Operating Speed): This is the maximum airspeed at which an aircraft is certified to operate in smooth air. Exceeding VMO can lead to structural damage due to excessive aerodynamic pressure. It's often referred to as the \"red line\" on the airspeed indicator.",
  "MMO": "MMO (Maximum Operating Mach): This is the maximum speed relative to the speed of sound (Mach number) at which an aircraft is certified to operate. At high altitudes, the speed of sound is lower, and the risk is from air compressibility effects creating  shockwaves on control surfaces, which can render them ineffective. MMO is the high-altitude equivalent of VMO.",
  "VLE": "VLE (Maximum Landing Gear Extended Speed): This is the maximum speed at which an aircraft can be safely flown with the landing gear down and locked. Flying faster than this speed can cause damage to the landing gear doors or the gear itself.",
  "VFE": "VFE (Maximum Flap Extended Speed): This is the maximum speed at which an aircraft can be flown with the flaps in a specific extended position. There are often multiple VFE speeds corresponding to different flap settings (e.g., for takeoff, landing). Exceeding VFE can damage the flap structures.",
  "Payload": "The maximum weight of the aircraft's payload.",
